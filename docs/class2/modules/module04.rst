Lab 4: BIG-IP Policies and iRules
=================================

In your customers environment the web servers retrieve images from a
different set of servers. In the lab you will write and iRule and create
a BIG-IP policies so you can compare and contrast the to methods. iRules
are more flexible and customizable, while BIG-IP policies are easier to
use, require no coding skills and are a little more efficient when
performing the same task.

Write an iRule to retrieve images when an HTTP request is received
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When HTTP request is received, look at the HTTP URI. If the URI ends
with **jpg** or **png** send the request to an alternate pool of image
servers.

1. **Create** a new pool named **image_pool**, use the **http** monitor
   for status and add one member **10.1.20.14:80**.

2. Go to **Local Traffic > iRules > iRules List** and select the create
   button.

   a. **Names:** retrieve_images

   b. **Definition:**

.. code::

   # If the content is a jpeg or portable graphic (png) go to the image pool
   when HTTP_REQUEST {
      if { ([HTTP::uri] ends_with "jpg") or ([HTTP::uri] ends_with "svg") }
      {
         pool image_pool
      }
   }

   c. Note the highlighted content, hover the pointer over HTTP_REQUEST and HTTP::uri to
   get information on the event and command.

3. Go to **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers** and open the **secure_vs**
   virtual server. Go to the **Resources** section.

   a. Under **iRules** select the **Manage** button and put the
      **retrieve_images** iRule into the **Enabled** box and add the
      iRule to the virtual server.

      i. What other profile did this iRule require to work?

4. Test your policy by going to https://10.1.10.105, you will want to
   use an incognito/private browsing window to avoid cached content.

a. Test your policy.  If you browse at your unsecured virtual server you will see there are multiple colors to the images, but browser the secure virtual server and all the image colors are the same because all the images were pulled from the same server (10.1.20.14)

b. Where is non-image requests go?  You can get an idea by clearing the pool statistics and reloading the page.

Use a BIG-IP Policy to retrieve images from a different pool 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this task you are going to the same thing as above, except you will
use a BIG-IP policy.

1. First you create your policy container and set your match strategy.
   Try to do this using the instructions, but a screen shot of the
   policy is available in the **Appendix** at the end of the lab guide
   if you would like it.

2. Go to **Local Traffic ›› Policies : Policy List** and select
   **Create**

   a. **Policy_Name:** access_image_pool

   b. **Strategy:** Execute **first** matching rule.

   c. **Create Policy**

   .. image:: /_static/101/image58.png
      :width: 2.67708in
      :height: 1.36123in

3. Now you can create/view policy rules. Select **Create**.

   a. **Name:** get_images

   b. In the box under **Match all the following conditions:** select
      the **+** to the right of **All traffic**

      i. Use the top drop down menu to select **HTTP URI**, on the next
         line of dropdown boxes select:

         1. **extension ends_with any of** (**Add** *jpg* and *svg*) at
            **request** time

   c. Under **Do the following when the traffic is matched:** build the
      following operation.

      i. **Forward Traffic** to **pool** **Common/image_pool** at
         **request** time.

d. **Save**

4. The policy is saved in **Draft** form and is not available/update
   until **Published**. To publish the policy:

a. Select the **Save Draft Policy** drop-down menu and select **Save and
   Publish Policy**.

5. Go to the **Resources** section of your **secure_vs** virtual server.

a. For **iRules**, select **Manage** and REMOVE the **retrieves_images** iRule from the virtual server.

b. For **Policies**, select **Manage** and move **access_image_pool** from the **Available** box to the
   **Enabled** box and hit **Finished**

. Test your policy.  If you browse at your unsecured virtual server you will see there are multiple colors to the images, but browser the secure virtual server and all the image colors are the same because all the images were pulled from the same server (10.1.20.14).  You can also use pools statistics to determine results.
