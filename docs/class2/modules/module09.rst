Lab 9: BIG-IP LTM Management Interface 
===================================

This lab is designed to teach students about the BIG-IP LTM (Local Traffic Manager) Management interface and its various configurations and access control settings. Students will gain hands-on experience to better understand management IP functionalities, connectivity, and the security settings associated with it. The lab consists of step-by-step instructions, covering each of your objectives.

Lab instructions
-----------------
This lab will use BIG-IP 01 and the Jumpbox. Students will execute TMSH commands in the Web Shell of BIG-IP 01. Afterwards, the students will test access on the Jumpbox. 
  
.. note::
   There are three methods add, delete, and replace-all-with for managing SSHD and HTTPD.



Objective 1: Identify the Configured Management-IP Address
----------------------------------------------------------

1. **Access the Web Shell for BIG-IP 01**

2. **Find the Management-IP**:

      .. code-block:: bash 
            
         tmsh list /sys management-ip

      .. image::  /_static/101/tmsh-management-ip.png
         :width: 400

   - Alternatively, check via the GUI:
   - Navigate to ``System > Platform`` and note the Management IP Address.

      .. image::  /_static/101/management-ip.png
         :width: 400

    .. note::
       We are using DHCP; therefore, IP address is not visible via the Config Utility

3. **Find the Management-Route**:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      tmsh list /sys management-route

   .. image::  /_static/101/tmsh-management-route.png
      :width: 400

Objective 2: SSHD ACLs (Access Control Lists)
---------------------------------------------

1. **Check Current SSH Access Control**:

   .. code-block:: bash

       tmsh list /sys sshd allow

   .. image::  /_static/101/ssh-allow.png
      :width: 400   

2. **Allow Access from the address 10.1.1.1(UDF IP Address)**:

   .. code-block:: bash

        tmsh modify /sys sshd allow replace-all-with { 10.1.1.1/32 }
        tmsh save /sys config

   .. image::  /_static/101/command-sshd-10-1-1-1.png
      :width: 400

3. **Test connectivity from the Jumpbox**:

   - `ssh root@10.1.1.4`

   - Verify that SSH connections from Jumpbox IP is denied.

   .. code-block:: bash

        tailf /var/log/secure

   .. image::  /_static/101/sshd-connection-refused.png
      :width: 400

4. **Cleanup**

   .. code-block:: bash

        tmsh modify /sys sshd allow replace-all-with { ALL }

   .. image::  /_static/101/ssh-restore-allow.png
       :width: 400   

Objective 3: HTTPD ACLs
-----------------------

1. **Check Current HTTP Access Control**:

   .. code-block:: bash

         tmsh list /sys httpd allow
   
   .. image::  /_static/101/http-allow.png
      :width: 400   

2. **Modify HTTP Access Control Settings to allow access from 10.1.1.1(UDF IP Address)**:

   .. code-block:: bash

         tmsh modify /sys httpd allow replace-all-with { 10.1.1.1/32 }
         tmsh save /sys config

   .. image::  /_static/101/http-limit.png
      :width: 400  

3. **Verify Access Control**:

   - Attempt logging into the Config Utility from the Jumpbox.

   - Verify that HTTP connections from other IPs are denied.

   .. code-block:: bash

        tailf /var/log/secure

   .. image::  /_static/101/sshd-connection-refused.png
      :width: 400

4. **Cleanup**
   
   .. code-block:: bash
      
        tmsh modify /sys httpd allow replace-all-with { ALL }
        tmsh list /sys httpd allow


   .. image::  /_static/101/http-restore-allow.png
      :width: 400   
.


Objective 4: Explain Management IP Connectivity Issue
-----------------------------------------------------

1. **Unreachability Scenarios**:

   - Discuss common reasons for Management IP connectivity issues:

     - Firewall blocking access to Management-IP.
     - Wrong subnet mask or gateway configuration on the BIG-IP.
     - Device is on a different VLAN or broadcast domain.
     - SSH/HTTP services are disabled or access control limits are in place.

2. **Troubleshoot Connectivity Issues**:

   - **Ping Test**: Verify if the Management IP is reachable using::

       ping <management IP>

   - Use the `tcpdump` utility on BIG-IP to monitor incoming connection requests on the management interface::

       tcpdump -ni mgmt port 22 or port 443


Lab Conclusion
--------------

By the end of this lab, students should:

- Understand and modify the Management IP address settings.
- Demonstrate remote connectivity to the BIG-IP system.
- Be able to troubleshoot Management IP connectivity issues.
- Configure SSH and HTTP/HTTPS access lists (ACLs) for the Management interface.
- Differentiate between improper and secure configurations for Management access.

Cleanup Tasks
-------------

- Revert any changes you made to the ACLs during the lab::

    tmsh modify /sys sshd allow replace-all-with { ALL }
    tmsh modify /sys httpd allow replace-all-with { ALL }
    save /sys config

- Validate that the Management IP is accessible as per the labâ€™s original configuration.
