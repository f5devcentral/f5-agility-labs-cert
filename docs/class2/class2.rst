**Overview  201 - TMOS Administration**

|

Welcome to the TMOS Administration compiled Study Guide. The purpose of this
guide is to help you prepare for the F5 201 - TMOS Administration exam. The
contents of this document are based on the 201 - TMOS Administration Exam
Blueprint for TMOS v11.4. 
 
**This study guide provides students with some of the basic foundational
knowledge required to pass the exam.**

Hands on experience with the Big-IP platform will reinforce many of the topics
contained in the TMOS Administration exam. F5 has created a virtual lab
environment that can be run on a laptop with VMware Workstation (Fusion for
Mac) or in a lab with an ESXi server. The f5 vLabs can help by providing access
to a lab environment in which your knowledge of the Big-IP platform can grow.
For access to the vLab guides and virtual machines please contact your local
F5 Sales Engineer.

This study guide is a collection of information and therefore not a completely
original work. The information was found mostly in F5 resources. All of the
information locations are referenced at each topic instead of in an Appendix
of this document. This was done to help the reader access the reference the
linked information easier without having to search through a formal appendix. 

The F5 Networks 101 - Application Delivery Fundamentals exam is a pre-requisite
to this exam. 
 
This guide was prepared by an F5 employee but is not an official F5 document
and is not supported by F5 Networks.
