Module 2 - Virtual Server and Pool Behavior and Status
======================================================

Virtual Server Status
---------------------

Test Disabled Virtual Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Q1. What is the Availability of* **www\_vs**\ *? What is the State?*

Availability: available, State: disabled

*Q2. What symbol is used to represent* **www\_vs** *status?*

Black Circle

*Q3. Would you expect browsing to http://10.1.10.100 to work?*

No

*Q4. Can you ping the virtual IP?*

Yes, the virtual address still responds to pings

*Q5. Did the site work? What did the tcpdump show?*

No, the tcpdump showed the virtual server 10.1.10.100:80 responding to
SYNs with Resets

*Q6. Did statistics counters for any virtual increment?*

No

*Q7. Why do you think the* **wildcard\_vs** *didn't pick up the packets?*

www\_vs was the most specific virtual server so it responded. Because the www_vs was disabled the response was to reset the connection.  This make sense if you think about it.  What good would it do to disable a virtual server just to have another virtual server pick up the traffic either process incorrectly or send it to servers you just tried to prevent traffic from going too.

*Q8. What symbol is used to represent* **wildcard\_vs**\ *? Why is symbol a
square?*

The status symbol is a black square. Black because the virtual server
was administratively disabled and square because there is no monitor and
the state is Unknown

*Q9. What is the reason given for current state?*

The children pool member(s) either don't have service checking enabled,
or service check results are not available yet. Availability: unknown
State: disabled

*Q10. Does ftp session still work? Why?*

Disabling a configuration item (node, pool or virtual server) does not
affect existing connections.

*Q11. Did new ftp session establish connection? Why not?*

No, a disabled virtual server will not process new connections.

Virtual Server Connection Limits and Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Q1. Does ftp session work?*

Yes

*Q2. What is the virtual server status of ftp\_vs?*

Yellow Triangle - Availability: unavailable - State: enabled

*Q3. Did new ftp session establish connection? Why not?*

No, the virtual server's connection limit has been reached.

*Q4. Did tcpdump capture show a connection reset?*

Yes, tcpdump revealed **R** TCP reset the connection.

Pool Member and Virtual Servers
-------------------------------

Effects of Monitors on Members, Pools and Virtual Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Q1. Since the* **mysql\_monitor** *will fail, how long will it take to
mark the pool offline?*

60 seconds, the monitor will have to fail 4 times at 15 second intervals
before it exceeds the 46 second timeout value.

*Q2. What is the icon and status of* **www\_vs**\ *?*

Red Diamond - Availability: offline - State: enabled - The children pool
member(s) are down

*Q3. What is the icon and status of* **www\_pool**\ *?*

Red Diamond - Availability: offline - State: enabled - The children pool
member(s) are down

*Q4. What is the icon and status of the* **www\_pool** *members?*

Red Diamond - Availability: offline - State: enabled - Pool member has
been marked down by a monitor

*Q5. Does pool configuration have an effect on virtual server status?*

Yes, the status of the pool members can affect the status of the virtual
server.

*Q6. What is the icon and status of* **www\_vs**\ *?*

Black Diamond - Availability: offline - State: disabled - The children
pool member(s) are down

*Q7. Did traffic counters increment for* **www\_vs**\ *?*

No

*Q8. What is the difference in the tcpdumps between Offline (Disabled) vs
Offline (Enabled)?*

Offline (Disabled) - immediate connection reset, you will see no virtual
server statistics.

Offline (Enabled) - initial connection accepted then reset, the virtual server stats are
incremented

More on status and member specific monitors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Q1. What is the status of the Pool Member and the monitors assigned to
it?*

Red Diamond - Red Diamond - Availability: offline - State: enabled -
Pool member has been marked down by a monitor

http - Green Circle, mysql\_monitor - Red Diamond

*Q2. What is the status of* **www\_vs**, **www\_pool** *and the pool
members? Why?*

Green, Green, Red, Red, Green. One pool member available, marks the pool
available and since the pool is available, the virtual server is
available

*Q3. Did the site work?*

Yes

*Q4. Which* **www\_pool** *members was traffic sent to?*

Traffic was distributed to availble pool members.

Load Balancing
--------------

Load Balancing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Q1. Which* **www\_pool** *members was traffic sent to?*

Traffic was distributed to 10.1.20.12 and 10.1.20.13

*Q2. Did member 10.1.20.12 receive the most traffic? Why not?*

No, because LB method is Round Robin, Ratio and Priority Group
configurations on pool members do not apply.

*Q3. Which* **www\_pool** *members was traffic sent to?*

Traffic was distributed to 10.1.20.12 and 10.1.20.13

*Q4. Did member 10.1.20.12 receive the most traffic?*

10.1.20.12 received 5x more traffic than 10.1.20.12

Priority Group Activation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Q1. Which* **www\_pool** *members was traffic sent* to?

Traffic was distributed to 10.1.20.11 and 10.1.20.12

*Q2. Which* **www\_pool** *members was traffic sent to? Why?*

Traffic was distributed to 10.1.20.12 and 10.1.20.13. Pool member
availability dropped below 2 available members in the highest priority
group and the next lowest priority group was activated.

*Q3. Would the results have been different if 10.1.20.11:80 had been
marked offline or marked with a yellow triangle?*

No, both mark the member as Unavailable, dropping the Available members
below 2.

The Effects of Persistence on Load Balancing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Q1. Why was a http profile required?*

The http profile was required to tell the BIG-IP to parse the http
request/response sequence for the virtual server so it could insert and
read cookies in the http headers.

*Q2. Was traffic evenly distributed to all* **www\_pool** *members? Why
not?*

Traffic went to only on pool member because of persistence,

*Q3. Did you persist to the Disabled member? Why?*

Yes, a Disable pool member will still receive new connections if a
persistence record points to it.

*Q4. Does traffic continue to persist to the member Forced Offline?*

No, another available member was selected and a new persistence record
was created

*Q5. If cookies were disable on your browser would persistence still
work? Why?*

Yes, source address persistence would be used to persist to a pool
member
