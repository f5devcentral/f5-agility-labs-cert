Pool Member and Virtual Servers
===============================

In this exercise, you will determine the effects of monitors, and on the status of pools members and virtual servers.  You will also review the hierarchal effects of changes in status of various configuration objects.

Create a new monitor
--------------------

Create **mysql** monitor for testing.

Go to **Local Traffic > Monitors** and select **Create**.

+----------------------+------------------+
| **Name**             | mysql\_monitor   |
+----------------------+------------------+
| **Parent Monitor**   | mysql            |
+----------------------+------------------+
| **Interval**         | 15               |
+----------------------+------------------+
| **Timeout**          | 46               |
+----------------------+------------------+

Effects of Monitors on Members, Pools and Virtual Servers
---------------------------------------------------------

Go to **Local Traffic > Pools > www\_pool** and assign ths
**mysql\_monitor** to the pool.

Observe availability status of **www\_pool.** The pool status
momentarily changes to **Unknown**.

*Q1. Since the* **mysql\_monitor** *will fail, how long will it take to
mark the pool offline?*

Go to **Local Traffic > Pool > www\_pool** and then **Member** from the
top bar and open member **10.1.20.13:80** and note the status of the
monitors.

Open **Local Traffic -> Network Map -> Show Map**

*Q2. What is the icon and status of* **www\_vs**\ *?*

*Q3. What is the icon and status of* **www\_pool**\ *?*

*Q4. What is the icon and status of the* **www\_pool** *members?*

*Q5. How does the status of the pool configuration effect the virtual
server status?*

Clear the virtual server statistics.

Browse to **http://10.1.10.100** and note the browser results,
statistics and tcpdump.

Disable **www\_vs** and clear the statistics and ping the virtual
server.

*Q6. What is the icon and status of* **www\_vs**\ *?*

Browse to **http://10.1.10.100** and note the browser results,
statistics and tcpdump..

*Q7. Did traffic counters increment for* **www\_vs**\ *?*

*Q8. What is the difference in the tcpdumps between Offline (Disabled) vs
Offliine (Enabled)?*

.. IMPORTANT:: 

   Make sure all virtual servers are **Enabled** before continuing.

More on status and member specific monitors
-------------------------------------------

Go to **Local Traffic > Pool > www\_pool** and then **Member** from the
top bar and open member **10.1.20.13:80.** Enable the **Configuration:
Advanced** menus.

*Q1. What is the status of the Pool Member and the monitors assigned to
it?*

In **Health Monitors** select **Member Specific** and assign the
**http** monitor and **Update.**

Go to the **Network Map**.

*Q2. What is the status of* **www\_vs**, **www\_pool** *and the pool
members?   Why?*

Browse to **http://10.1.10.100** and note results of browser and
tcpdump.

*Q3. Did the site work?*

*Q4. Which* **www\_pool** *members was traffic sent to?*

.. IMPORTANT::

   After completing this task remove **mysql\_monitor** from the
   **www\_pool** health monitors
