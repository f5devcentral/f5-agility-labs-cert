Open BIG-IP TMSH and TCPDump session
------------------------------------

In this task, you will open two SSH sessions to the BIG-IP. One for TMSH
commands and the other for a tcpdump of the client-side network.

Open a terminal window (window1) from the shortcut bar at the
bottom of the jumpbox.

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh root@10.1.1.4
   password: f5UDFrocks!

Use tcpdump to monitor traffic from the client (10.1.10.6) destined to
**ftp\_vs** (10.1.10.100)

.. code-block:: bash

   tcpdump -nni client_vlan host 10.1.10.6 and 10.1.10.100

Open another terminal window (window2) and use **tmsh** to display the
connection table.

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh root@10.1.1.4
   tmsh

At the TMOS prompt **(tmos)#**

.. admonition:: TMSH
   
   show sys connection type any

Do you see any connections from the jumpbox 10.1.1.6 to 10.1.1.245:22 in the connection table?

*Q1. Why are the ssh management sessions to 10.1.1.4 not displayed in connection
table?*

Establish ftp connection
------------------------

In this task you will open a third terminal window and establish an FTP
session through the **ftp\_vs** virtual server. With the connection
remaining open you will view the results in window1 (tcpdump) and
window2 (tmsh).

Open a third command/terminal window (window3).

.. code-block:: bash

   ftp 10.1.10.100

In the first terminal window ( window1) you should see something similar to the tcpdump captured
below.

.. image:: /_static/201L/201ex211t2a-tcpdump.png

*Q1. In the tcpdump above, what is client IP address and port and the
server IP address port?*

In window2 (tmsh) run the **show sys conn** again, but strain out the
noise of other connections (mirrored and selfIP) by just looking at
connections from your jumpbox.

.. code-block:: bash

   show sys conn cs-client-addr 10.1.10.6

The connection table on window2 will show the client-side and
server-side connection similar to below:

.. image:: /_static/201L/201ex211t2b-shsysconn.png

*Q2. What is source ip and port as seen by ftp server in the example
above?*

*Q3. What happened to the original client IP address and where did
10.1.20.249 come from?*

.. HINT::
   You will have to review the configuration of **ftp\_vs** to  determine the answer to question 3.
