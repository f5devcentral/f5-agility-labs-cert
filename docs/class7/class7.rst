**Overview 301A - BIG-IP LTM Specialist: Architect, Set-Up & Deploy**

|

Welcome to the 301a - LTM Specialist compiled Study Guide. The purpose of this
guide is to help you prepare for the F5 301a - LTM Specialist exam. The
contents of this document are based on the 301a - LTM Specialist Exam
Blueprint for TMOS v11.5.
 
**This study guide provides students with some of the basic foundational
knowledge required to pass the exam.**

*This study guide is a collection of information and therefore not a completely
original work.* The majority of the information is compiled from F5 sources
that are located on the Internet. All of the information locations are
referenced at the top of each topic instead of in an appendix of this document.
This was done to help the reader access the referenced information easier
without having to search through a formal appendix.   

The F5 Certified Big-IP Administrator (F5-CA), which is made up of the 101 -
App Delivery Fundamentals and 201 - TMOS Administration exams, stands as a
pre-requisite to this exam. 

Taking certified F5 LTM training, such as Administering BIG-IP v11 and
Configuring BIG-IP LTM v11, will surely help with the topics of this exam but
does not teach directly to the exam content. Hands on administrative experience
with the Big-IP platform licensed with LTM will reinforce many of the topics
contained in the 301a - LTM Specialist exam.
 
This guide was prepared by an F5 employee but is not an official F5 document
and is *not* supported by F5.

**Reading = Knowledge = Power**

**Printed References**

These referenced books are important and should be considered basic reading
material for this exam.  However these reading materials are not available for
purchase. You can only gain access to the books by attending the associated F5
training class. These official F5 classes are now being offered in v12
and v13. So, if you have the newer copy of the material that is fine, be aware
that the exam is based on the 11.5 version and content could have changed. It
is possible that an ATC for F5 may still offer older 11.5 training but
this is not guaranteed.
