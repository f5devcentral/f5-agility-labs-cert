Configure Audit Logging
-----------------------

Audit logging allows you to log changes made by BIG-IP administrators and other users.

#. Audit logging is disabled by default. **Go to System > Logs > Configuration**.

#. Notice you can determine by role who is allowed to view the audit logs.

#. Audit Logging is toward the bottom of the page. **Enable** Audit Logging

#. In a private browser window, log on to the BIG-IP as **adminuser/password**.

#. Make a change to the **Description** of the FTP virtual server **ftp\_vs**.

#. Review the audit log at **System > Logs > Audit**. In the **Search** box type **adminuser** and hit **Search**.

    *Q1. Do you see when adminuser logged on? Do you see the change made in the audit log?*

Limiting SSH access to the BIG-IP
---------------------------------

#. The jumpbox has two IPs, 10.1.1.6 on the management network, 10.1.10.199 on the client-side network.

#. Open **System > Platform** and in **SSH IP Allow** > **Specify Range** of **10.1.20.0/24**

    *Q1. Does existing an SSH window still work? Does a new SSH work?*

#. Change the **Specify Range** to the management network only **10.1.1.0/24**.
