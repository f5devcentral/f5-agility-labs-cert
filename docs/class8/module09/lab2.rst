Remote Authentication
=====================

   .. NOTE::

      Due to the lab environment this will no longer work, but it does give
      you the general concept of how remote authentication is set up.

Authenticate against LDAP
-------------------------

#. Go to **System > Users > Authentication** and select **Change** under **User Directory**.

#. Now select **LDAP** from the **User Directory** drop-down and enter the following

   +-------------------------+------------------------+
   | Host                    | 10.1.20.252            |
   +-------------------------++-----------------------+
   | Remote Directory Tree   | dc=f5demo,dc=com       |
   +-------------------------+------------------------+
   | Bind DN:                | cn=Directory Manager   |
   +-------------------------+------------------------+
   | Bind Password/Confirm   | default                |
   +-------------------------+------------------------+
   | Role                    | Administrator          |
   +-------------------------+------------------------+

#. Open a new private browser window to **bigip01** at **https://10.1.1.4** and logon using the LDAP account **adminuser/password**.

   *Q1. Were you successful?*

#. Try logging with the local account **testuser/testpass**.

   *Q2. Were you successful?*
