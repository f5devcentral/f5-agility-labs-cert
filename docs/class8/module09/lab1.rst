Roles and Partitions
====================

Create a partition
------------------

Partitions are basically configuration containers. Users assigned to a partition can only view their partition configuration and configuration items in the **Common** partition. Depending on their role a user may modify and create configuration items within their partition and use (but not modify) configuration items in
the common partition.

#. To create a new partition, go to **System > Users > Partition List** and select create

#. Create a new partition named **my\_partition**. There is really not a whole lot to it.

Create and place a user in a partition
--------------------------------------

#. Create a new local user by going to **System > Users > User List** and selecting create.

#. Create a new user **testuser** with **testpass** as the password and set their **Role** to **Manager**, assign them to the **test\_partition** partition and give them **tmsh Terminal Access**

#. Open a new private browser to the BIG-IP, or log out and log back in under your current browser as the new user **testuser/testpass**.

   *Q1. In the upper right of the BIG-IP WebUI what partition are you in?*

#. Look at the virtual servers. You can see these because they were all built in the Common partition, but you cannot modify them. If you go into a virtual server you will see the selections greyed out.

#. As you can see, you can view but not change things in common. But you can use things in the **Common** partition to build your own configuration.

#. Build a new HTTP virtual server named **test\_vs**, with a destination IP of **10.1.10.120** and used the **www\_pool** in the **/Common** partition as the default pool.

#. In this case we are taking advantage of the **Common** partition nodes and pools to build are virtual server.

#. Log out and log in as **admin** (or go to your other browser window that is logged in as admin)

#. Go to the **Virtual Server List**.

   *Q2. Do you see the* **test\_vs** *just created?*

#. Go to the upper right-hand corner and select **test\_partition**. You can now see the **test\_vs** virtual server. Since you are an admin you can also modify the virtual server as necessary

#. SSH to your BIG-IP and log in with the new user name and password.  You should be taken directly into the **tmsh**.

#. Note the prompt, your partition name is there.

#. Now let's make a change to the test\_vs::

      mod ltm virtual test\_vs description "Partition Testing"

#. In the BIG-IP WebUI go to your **test_vs** virtual server.

   *Q3. Do you see your change? Is your change permanent?*

   .. NOTE::

      **The following lab portion is probably not on the 301, but as I have you playing with partitions this is something if feel you should know.**

#. SSH to the BIG-IP and log in as **root**. **cat** or **more** bigip.conf and look for you **test\_vs** virtual::

      cat bigip.conf
      more bigip.conf

   *Q4. Did you find it in /config/bigip.conf?*

#. Each partition gets its own "folder" where its configuration is stored under the **partitions** directory in the **/config** directory. At the BIG-IP CLI prompt::

      cd /config/partitions/test_partition
      ls
      cat bigip.conf

   *Q5. Did you find your virtual server? Is the tmsh change you made in there?*

#. As **testuser** at the tmsh prompt type: **save sys config**

#. Look at your **bigip.conf** in the **test_partition**.**

   *Q6. Do you see the change now?*

#. Attempt to exit tmsh to get to the Linux CLI.

   *Q7. Where you able to?*
