Traffic Groups
==============

Build a New Traffic Group.
--------------------------

You are now going to build an active-active cluster by creating a new traffic-group and forcing that traffic group to run on the Standby BIG-IP.

#. On your **Active** BIG-IP, go to **Device Management > Traffic Groups** and create a new traffic group called **tg-2**.

#. Place the **www\_vs** in the new **tg-2** traffic group.

#. Remember you place virtual address, not virtual servers, in a traffic group.

#. Go the **Virtual Server List**, note the IP address of **www\_vs** and select **Virtual Address** from the top bar.

#. Under the **Virtual Address** select the traffic group you want to assign it to, **tg-2**.

    *Q1. When you did this, what other virtual servers were assign to tg-2?*

#. On the **Active** BIG-IP, under **Device Management** select **tg-2** note the **Next Active Device** and **Force to Standby**.

    *Q2. What are the states of you BIG-IPs?*

#. Browse to **http://10.1.10.100** and ftp to **10.1.10.100**.

    *Q3. Did the web site work? What was the client IP? Did ftp work? Why or why not?*

#. It is important to get all the listeners that support an application into the same traffic group.

#. Go to your ftp SNAT pool and note the address, then go to the **SNAT Translation List** select the IP and place it in **tg-2**.

#. FTP to **10.1.10.100**.

    *Q4. Did it work now?*
