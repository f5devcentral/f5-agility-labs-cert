Failover and Mirroring
======================

Testing Failover
----------------

Now that you have created your HA environment let's play with it. In this lab, you will set up mirroring and perform failover and synchronization of updates.

#. Ensure **bigip02** is the **Active** BIG-IP. If **bigip01** is the **Active** BIG-IP then go to **Device Management >> Traffic Groups**. Select **traffic-group-1** and hit the **Force to Standby** button.

#. Browse to **http://10.1.10.100**?

    *Q1. What is the source IP in the* **Request Details**?

#. Browse to **http://10.1.10.115**?

    *Q2. What happened? Why?*

#. The default gateway for the servers in the **secure\_pool** is **10.1.20.240**. This IP is currently assigned to **traffic-group-local-only** in **bigip01** and resides in the **bigip\_base.conf**. We need this IP address to float to the active
   BIG-IP upon failover. Because we are changing this from a base IP to a floating IP you will encounter an error when trying to sync the configuration. Incremental updates are the default sync method, but sometimes a full overwrite is required.

#. On **bigip01**, open the self IP **server\_gw** (10.1.20.240) and assign it to the default floating traffic group **traffic-group-1.**

#. Select **Changes Pending** or **Device Management** > **Overview**.

#. From the **Overview** page, select **bigip01.f5demo.com**, select **Sync Device to Group**, select **Overwrite Configure** and select **Sync**.

#. Browse to **http://10.1.10.115**.

    *Q3. Did the site work? What was the client IP?*  

#. Browse to **http://10.1.10.100**.

    *Q4. What was the client IP address that the server saw (under* **Request Details** *on the main page)? Why?*

#. Failover the active BIG-IP by going to **Device Management  > Devices >** **<device name> (self)** and at the bottom of the page select **Force to Standby**. This is how a system level failover is performed.

    *Q5. Does http://10.1.10.115 still work? What is the client IP?*

Mirroring
---------

Once you place a BIG-IP in a device group, mirroring selections will show up for SNAT objects, persistence profiles and connection mirroring on virtual servers. The BIG-IP will only mirror records created after mirroring is enabled. Let's see how mirroring persistence works, as an example.

#. Go to your **Active** BIG-IP.

#. Open your **www\_vs** virtual server and add **src-persist** as your **Persistence Profile**.

#. On each BIG-IP go to **Module Statistics > Local Traffic** and bring up the **Persistence Record** statistics.

#. Browse to **http://10.1.10.100**.

    *Q1. Do you have a persistence record on each BIG-IP? What would happen if you did a failover?*

#. Go to your persistence profile **my-src-persist** and check the **Mirror Persistence** box.

#. Synchronize your changes.

#. On each BIG-IP go to **Module Statistics > Local Traffic** and bring up the **Persistence Record** statistics.

#. SSH to your active BIG-IP and view your persistence records. In TMSH run the following command::

    show /ltm persistence persistence-records

#. Note the CLI/TMSH prompt, you can find the sync status and the BIG-IP state.

#. For this lab, if you have any persistence records delete them::

    delete /ltm persistence persistence-records

#. Browse to **http://10.1.10.100** and refresh the page few times.

#. Check the persistence records on each of your BIG-IPs, you should see the records are mirrored on each device.

    *Q2. If you had persistence records existing prior to mirroring would they appear on the standby box?*

#. Go to **Device Management > Traffic Groups**. Select the default traffic group **traffic-group-1** and check out the **Next Active Device**.

#. Refresh the web page at **http://10.1.10.100**, and in **traffic-group-1**, select **Force to Standby**.

#. Browse or refresh **http://10.1.10.100**.

    *Q3. Did you persist to the correct pool member? What is the client IP?*
