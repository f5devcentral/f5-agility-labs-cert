Working with Analytics (AVR)
============================

AVR Lab Setup - Verify provisioning, iRules and Data Group
----------------------------------------------------------

In this task you prep the BIG-IP for the Application Visibility and
Reporting (AVR) lab. In the interest of time AVR has already been
provisioned, a data group has been built and two iRules have been
prepopulated on the BIG-IP.

#. AVR is **NOT** provisioned by default, but should be already be provisioned on this BIG-IP. You can verify this by going to **System >>
   Resource Provisioning**. Application Visibility and Reporting should be set to Nominal.

      *Q1. What resources does AVR require to be provisioned?*

#. Go to **Local Traffic > iRules > iRules List** and select **Data Group List** from the top-bar

#. A **Data Group** named **user\_agents** has already been created for you.

      +--------------+-------------+
      | **String**   | **Value**   |
      +==============+=============+
      | agent        | IE9         |
      +--------------+-------------+
      | agent1       | IE11        |
      +--------------+-------------+
      | agent2       | IE11        |
      +--------------+-------------+
      | agent3       | Chrome      |
      +--------------+-------------+
      | agent4       | Firefox     |
      +--------------+-------------+
      | agent5       | Safari      |
      +--------------+-------------+
      | agent6       | iPhone5     |
      +--------------+-------------+
      | agent7       | iPhone6     |
      +--------------+-------------+
      | agent8       | iPhone6     |
      +--------------+-------------+
      | agent9       | Android     |
      +--------------+-------------+

#. To save time and typing errors, the iRules required for this lab have already been configured on the BIG-IP. Find the iRules below under **Local Traffic > iRules > iRule List** and verify the iRules exist.
   We use these iRules to modify traffic and give Analytics something interesting to see.

#. **random\_client\_ip** - randomizes the client IPs and user agents using the data group you built::

      when CLIENT_ACCEPTED {
      # Create a random IP address and use it to replace the client IP to simulate many clients
      # going through the virtual
         snat [expr int(rand()*255)].[expr int(rand()*255)].[expr int(rand()*255)].[expr int(rand()*254)]
         virtual avr_virtual2
      }
      when HTTP_REQUEST {
      # When the HTTP request comes in, select a random user agents and put that agent
      # in the user-agent HTTP header to simulate many different user agents
         set my_index [expr int(rand()*10)]
         set user_agent [class element -value $my_index user_agents]
            HTTP::header replace user-Agent $user_agent
      }

      *Q2. Review the iRule, what profiles are required on the virtual server?*

#. **delay_server** - introduces delay into server-side traffic::

      when LB_SELECTED {
      # After a member has been selected by the load balancing algorithm introduce delay
      # (in milliseconds) on the specified URL or server
         if {([LB::server addr] equals "10.1.20.13") and ([HTTP::uri] equals "/welcome.php")} { after 10}
      
         if {[LB::server addr] equals "10.1.20.13"} {after 20}
      }

      *Q3. Review the iRule, what profiles are required on the virtual server?*

Create an Analytics Profile
---------------------------

Create an analytics profile that will be used with a virtual server.

#. In the Configuration Utility, open the **Local Traffic > Profiles > Analytics** page, and then click **Create**.

#. Create an analytics profile using the following information, and then click **Finished**.

   +--------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | **Profile Name**         | custom_analytics                        |

Create a Web Application
------------------------

.. NOTE:: 

   The **avr_virtual2** destination address is the default gateway of the web servers.

#. Create a virtual server with the following settings: 

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 40 30

         *  - Name 
            - **avr_virtual2**
         *  - Destination Address
            - **10.1.20.240**
         *  - Service Port
            - **80 (HTTP)**
         *  - Configuration
            - **Advanced**
         *  - HTTP Profile
            - **http**
         *  - Source Address Translation
            - **Auto Map**
         *  - Analytics Profile
            - **custom_analytics**
         *  - iRules 
            - **delay_server**
         *  - Default Pool 
            - **www_pool**
 
#. Create another virtual server using the following information, and then click Finished.

      .. NOTE:: 

         Within the iRule attached to this virtual you are pointing traffic to the virtual server you created above, so avr_virtual2 had to be created first.

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 40 30

         *  - Name 
            - **avr_virtual1**
         *  - Destination Address
            - **10.1.10.90**
         *  - Service Port
            - **80 (HTTP)**
         *  - HTTP Profile
            - **http**
         *  - iRules 
            - **random_client_ip**

View the Analytics Reports
--------------------------

#. Use the **Analytics** page to view statistics information on the BIG-IP system.
