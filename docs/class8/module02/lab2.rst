Application Acceleration
========================

TCP Express
-----------

Set client-side and server-side TCP profiles on your virtual server
properties.

#. From the drop-down menus place the **tcp-wan-optimized** profile on the client-side

#. Place the **tcp-lan-optimized** profile on the server-side.

    Note the custom boxes in each of the TCP profiles you used.

    *Q1. What is the idle timeout in each profile? Why might you want to change it?*

    *Q2. What is the Nagle selection in the default TCP, tcp-wan-optimized and tcp-lan-optimized profiles? Why might you want to change it?*

    *Q3. What happens if you increase the proxy buffer sizes?*

HTTP Optimization - RamCache Lab
--------------------------------

#. Go to your virtual server and refresh server times. Note the Source Node for the pictures of the BIG-IPs. They change depending on where the connection is coming from. The Source Node information is part of the picture.

#. Go to **Local Traffic > Profiles > Services > Web Acceleration** or **Acceleration > Profiles > Web Acceleration**

#. Create a new profile named **www-opt-caching** using **optimized-caching** as the Parent Profile.

    Take all the defaults, no other changes are required.

    *Q1. What resource would be consumed if you increased the* **Cache Size** *setting?*

#. Open up your **www\_vs** virtual server.

#. At the HTTP Profile drop down menu make sure http is selected.

#. Under **Acceleration** at **Web** **Acceleration** **Profile** select your new caching profile; **www-opt-caching**

#. Clear the statistics on the **www\_pool**.

#. Browse to **http://10.1.10.100**. Refresh the main web page several times.

    *Q2. The pictures do not change. Why do you think that is?*

    *Q3. Go to your pool. Are all pool members taking connections?*

#. Now go to **Statistics > Module Statistics > Local Traffic** on the sidebar, from the **Statistics Type** drop down menu select **Profiles Summary** and select the **Web Acceleration** profile view link. Note the information.

#. You can get more detailed information on Web Acceleration profils and cache entries at the CLI level

#. Log onto the CLI of your BIG-IP via SSH using the root account (root/default).

#. At the CLI go into **tmsh** at the (tmos)# prompt and enter::

    show ltm profile ramcache www-opt-caching

HTTP Optimization - HTTP Compression Lab
========================================

#. Browse to **http://10.1.10.100**. On the web page under, **HTTP Request and Response Information** select the **Request and Response Headers** link.

    *Q1. Does the browser accept compression?*

#. Go to Local **Traffic > Profiles > Service > HTTP** **Compression** or **Acceleration > Profiles > HTTP Compression**

#. Create a new profile, named **www-compress** using the **wan-optimized-compression** default profile.

    *Q2. At what point would the BIG-IP quit compressing responses?*

#. Open up your **www\_vs** virtual server.

#. At the **Web Acceleration** drop down menu select **None**

    .. NOTE::

      For purpose of this lab we don't want caching interfering with our
      response headers.

#. At the **HTTP Compression** drop down menu select the HTTP compression profile you just created.

#. Browse the virtual server web site and on the web page under **Content Examples on This Host** select the **HTTP Compress Example** and **Plaintext Compress Example** link.

#. Now off to **Statistics** on the sidebar, under the **Local Traffic** drop down menu select **Profiles Summary**

#. Select the **View** link next to the **HTTP Compression** profile type

#. On the web page under, **HTTP Request and Response Information** select the **Request and Response Headers** link. Notice you no longer see the **Accept-Encoding** header in the **Request Headers Received** at the Server section.

#. You can also browse to **https://10.1.10.115** and note what the request/response looks like unchanged.
