Working with Profiles
=====================

#. Create a new pool called **secure\_pool**, using the **https** default monitor and add the following members, **10.1.20.11:443, 10.1.20.12:443** and **10.1.20.13.443.**

#. Create new virtual server **secure\_vs** at **10.1.10.115:443** with **TCP** the profile using your new **secure\_pool**.

#. Open two separate PuTTy/Terminal windows to the BIG-IP and run the following tcpdumps using the jumpbox 10.1.10.x IP address.

      Window 1::

         tcpdump -nni client_vlan -X -s0 host 10.1.10.199 and 10.1.10.115

      Window 2::

         tcpdump -nni server_vlan -X -s0 host 10.1.10.199

#. Verify your virtual server is available and then browse to **https://10.1.10.115**. View the TCPDUMPs.

      *Q1. Did site work? Why didn't you need to SNAT? Did you need SSL profiles?*

      *Q2. Could you use L7 iRules or profiles to view or modify the request or response? Why or why not?*

#. Modify **secure\_vs** to use the HTTP (80) **www\_pool**. 

#. Verify your virtual server is available and then browse to **https://10.1.10.115**.  View the TCPdumps.

      *Q3. Did site work? Why or not?*

#. Change SSL Profile to include the default **clientssl** then update.

#. Browse to **https://10.1.10.115** and observe the tcpdump.

      *Q4. Did site work? What did you observe in the tcpdumps? Did you need an HTTP profile?*

#. On the **secure\_vs** in the virtual server **Resources** section enable **cookies** as the **Default Persistence Profile** and then **Update**.

      *Q5. Did it work? What was needed to add cookie persistence?*

#. Browse to **https://10.1.10.115/** scroll and select **Display Cookie** in the **HTTP Request and Response Information** section on the web page.

      *Q6. What nodes do the pictures come from? What is the name of the cookie inserted begin with?*

#. Assign the **secure\_pool** to the **secure\_vs** once again. Browse to **https://10.1.10.115**

      *Q5. Did site work? Why or why not?*

#. Troubleshoot and fix.

      *Q6. What profile was needed to correct the error?*
