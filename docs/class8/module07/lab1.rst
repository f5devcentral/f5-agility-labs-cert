Load Balancing
==============

Ratio Load Balancing
--------------------

#. Go to Local **Traffic > Pools** and select **www\_pool** and then **Members** from the top bar or you could click on the **Members** link in the **Pool List** screen.

   .. HINT:: 

      When we created the pool, we performed all our configuration on one page, but when we modify a pool the Resource information is under the Members tab

#. Under **Load Balancing** section change the **Load Balancing Method** to **Ratio (Member)**

#. In drop-down menu, notice most load balancing methods have two options, **(Node)** or **(Member)**.

      *Q1. What is the difference between Node and Member?*

#. Select the first member in the pool **10.1.20.11:80** and change the **Ratio** of the member to **3**

#. Open the pool statistics and reset the statistics for **www\_pool**.

#. Browse to **http://10.1.10.100** and refresh the browser screen several times.

      *Q2. How many Total connections has each member taken? Is the ratio of connections correct?*

#. Now go back and put the pool back to **Round Robin** Load Balancing Method

#. Reset the pool statistics and refresh the virtual server page several times.

      *Q3. Does the ratio setting have any impact now?*

.. NOTE::
   
   Remember that if you have a browser open already connected to http://10.1.10.100 the connection will continue to use the settings from before you modified the pool.  Make sure to close chrome and open a new instance or open an incognito instance to start a completely new session.

Priority Groups Lab
-------------------

Let's look at priority groups. In this scenario we will treat the 10.1.20.13 server as if it was is in a disaster recovery site that can be reached over a backhaul. You want to maintain at least two members in the pool for
redundancy and load.  You would traffic to be distributed t0 10.1.20.13 only during maintenance of one on the two primary servers or if one to the two other pool members fails.

   .. NOTE::

      Remove any caching profiles from the www\_vs virtual server (10.1.10.100).

#. Go to the **www\_pool** **Members** section. Make sure the load balancing method is **Round Robin**.

#. Set the **Priority Group Activation** to less than **2** Available Members.

#. Select the pool members **10.1.20.11** and **10.1.20.12** and set their **Priority Group** to **10**.

#. Review your settings and let's see how load balancing reacts now.

#. Select the **Statistics** tab, reset the pool statistics, browse to **http://10.1.10.100** and refresh several times.

      *Q1. Are all members taking connections? Which member isn't taking connections?*

#. Let's simulate a maintenance window or an outage by disabling a pool member **10.1.20.11:80** in the highest priority group. This should cause low priority group to be activated, since number of active members
   in our high priority group has dropped below 2.

      *Q2. Is the lower priority group activated and taking connections?*

#. Select a member in the **Priority Group** 10 and **Disable** that pool member.

#. Once again, select **Statistics**, reset the pool statistics, browse to the virtual server and see which pool members are taking hits now.

   .. IMPORTANT::

      Once you are done testing re-enable your disabled pool member.

Simple (Source Address) Persistence 
===================================

You have already seen cookie persistence at work, but if the client or application (ie. ftp) does not support cookies you must use and alternate method. The most common is Simple Persistence which is based on the source IP address/network.

#. Verify your **www\_pool** is using **Round Robin** load balancing and the priority groups are disabled.

#. Browse to **http://10.1.10.100** and refresh several times. You should see all 3 servers respond.

#. Go to **Local Traffic > Profiles** and select the **Persistence** tab and from the **Persistence** **Profiles** screen select the **Create** button.

#. Create a new persistence profile named **my-src-persist** with a **Persistence Type** of **Source Address Affinity** and set the **Timeout** to **120** seconds and leave **Mask: None**

   .. NOTE:: 

      The **Mask: None** defaults to **255.255.255.255** which means each new IP address will create a new persistence record.

#. Now let's attach the new persistence profile to the **www\_vs** virtual server.

   .. HINT:: 

      When you create a Virtual Server everything is on a single page, when you return to modified the Virtual Server the Properties and Resources are on different pages.

#. Set the **Default Persistence Profile** to **my-src-persist**.

#. Test your Source Address Affinity persistence profile.

#. At this point you may want to open a second browser window to the BIG-IP GUI.

#. Go to **Statistics > Module Statistic > Local Traffic** and select **Persistence Records** from the **Statistics Type** menu.

#. In this window, you can watch you persistence records. You may want to set **Auto Refresh** to 20 seconds.

#. In another BIG-IP GUI window go to **www\_pool** and clear the member statistics.

#. Browse to **http://10.1.10.100** and refresh several times.

      *Q1. How many members are taking traffic?*

      *Q2. Check you Persists Records window, are the any persistence records?*

      *Q3. Refresh you web page prior to the Age column reaching 120. What happens?*

#. While the persistence recorded is still active **Disable** the member you are persisted too and refresh the browser page.

      *Q4. Could you access the web site? Why?*

#. While the persistence recorded is still active, go the member specific menu of the member you are persisted too and do a **Force Offline** and refresh the browser page.

      *Q5. Could you access the web site? Why?*

   .. IMPORTANT::

      Re-enable the pool members before continuing.
