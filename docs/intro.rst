Your First F5 Certification
----------------------------

|

F5 Certified Sales Professional (F5-SP)
There are two paths to take to for your first F5 certification.  Each path is separate from the other.  The first professional certification in the program is the F5 Certified!

Exam 101 is a prerequisite to Exam 201; no certificate is issued after passing Exam 101. 

The sections that follow give a brief overview of the first two exams and the skills needed to pass them.

|

**Exam 101 - Application Delivery Fundamentals**

This is the first exam required to achieve either F5 Certified BIG-IP Administrator status or F5 Certified Sales Professional. All candidates must take this exam to move forward in the program.

Successful completion of the 101-Application Delivery Fundamentals exam acknowledges the skills and understanding necessary for day-to-day management of Application Delivery Networks (ADNs). This exam identifies candidates that possess the knowledge that is necessary to work with F5 products and technologies.

*Summary description of the minimally qualified candidate (MQC)*

**Exam 201 - TMOS Administration**

This is the second exam required to achieve Certified F5 BIG-IP Administrator status. Candidates must have passed the 101-Application Delivery Fundamentals exam in order to be eligible for the 201 exam.

Successful completion of the BIG-IP Administrator exam identifies candidates who can independently perform day-to-day operations and basic troubleshooting of TMOS-based devices in various application environments after it has been installed, configured, and implemented.

*Summary description of the MQC*

The MQC is capable of performing day-to-day operations of TMOS-based devices which have already been installed. The MQC is also capable of basic troubleshooting of a TMOS-based device in order to provide full, accurate, and appropriate information to senior engineers and/or F5 support.

The MQC can do the following without assistance:

-Enable a virtual server that has already been defined.

-Locate where iRules are facilitated within QKView.

-Use QKView troubleshooting tools (for example, obtain a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) dump and a qkview using QKView, and upload a qkview to BIG-IP iHealth).

*Prerequisite for exam:*

- Exam 101 - Application Delivery Fundamentals

|

**Exam 202 - Pre-Sales Fundamentals**

This is the second exam required to achieve F5 Certified Sales Professional status. All candidates must have passed the 101-Application Delivery Fundamentals exam in order to achieve F5 Certified Sales Professional status.

Exam Preparation
-----------------

|

**Available Resources**

To prepare for certification exams, there are a number of resources available to candidates. Seven of these resources are listed below. Please know that there are no specific “exam prep” classes that guarantee you will pass an exam the first time. Earning an F5 certification typically requires both hands-on experience as well as studying the material. It is important to note that the responsibility of preparation lies with you, the candidate.

**Exam Blueprint**

Each exam has its own unique blueprint that was developed by subject matter experts (SMEs). The blueprint provides a detailed breakdown of the skills and knowledge that you should possess in order to pass the exam. Blueprints can be used to identify areas for additional study and are best used in conjunction with the exam study guides.

|

**Exam Study Guides**

Exam-specific study guides are available here on F5 Cloud Docs as well as on AskF5 in PDF format. These study guides feature a collection of information and resources that may be helpful for exam preparation. Study guides have been created by the F5 Certified! community and are not refreshed at the same time as exams.  The content here on F5 Cloud Docs will be the most current study guide content available.

|

**Learn F5**

`Learn F5  <https://account.f5.com/learnf5/signin>`__ provides several free web-based trainings appropriate to use to prepare for Exam 101. A good place to start with F5 web-based training is the “Getting Started” series.

|

**LinkedIn Groups**

F5 Certified! LinkedIn groups are a great place to engage with a community of candidates and Certification Team support. In the various LinkedIn groups, you may ask or answer questions, provide and gather resources, and give feedback on the program. 
The “F5 Certified! Professionals” group is the main group, and there are separate study groups for each exam. To find a group, log into your LinkedIn account and perform a search. The two groups that are the most helpful for getting started are:
 
- F5 Certified! Professionals

- F5 Certified! 101 Study Group

|

.. image:: /_static/_intro/1p9.png

As you become more familiar with the F5 Certified! Program and advance to subsequent exams, you can access additional F5 Certified! groups that have been created specifically for the next level that you wish to pursue.

**The following is strictly prohibited in the LinkedIn groups:** sharing specific exam questions or topics; detailed exam questions; and sharing exam scenarios, situations, examples, or exhibits. Failure to follow these guidelines will lead to expulsion from the certification program.

|

**Practice Exams**
 
F5 Certified! practice exams are designed to help gauge preparedness for the production (“real”) exams. They contain the same number of items, time constraints, and level of difficulty. They simulate the proctored, production exam experience. In addition, practice exams provide a score report with section-level guidance on your performance. This score report is only available with the official F5 Certified! practice exam. A nominal fee is charged for practice exams. 
An example of a practice exam score report is shown below: 

|

.. image:: /_static/_intro/1p10.png

The feedback in the score report provides a general assessment of your readiness for each section in the exam. Feedback is provided based on the following general levels of preparedness: 

-	Below: You are not prepared for this section. More study is required. 
-	Borderline: You demonstrate understanding, but not consistently. More study would benefit your exam performance. 
-	Meets: Suggests that you have sufficiently mastered this section. 

This section-level feedback is intended only as guidance. While earning a “Meets” score for all sections in the practice exam suggests that you would likely pass the real exam, it does not guarantee it. A practice exam is merely a tool to help you evaluate where you would benefit from additional preparation.

|

**F5.com**

An overview of basic information about the F5 Certified! Program is available on the F5 corporate website, `f5.com <https://www.f5.com>`__. This website contains information that will help you understand the F5 product suite and provides a high-level overview of the F5 Certified! Program.

|

**F5 Candidate Portal**

The first step to certification was creating an account in the `F5 Candidate Portal <https://www.certmetrics.com/f5certified/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2ff5certified%2f>`__. If you are reading this handbook, you have already completed this step and have been assigned a Candidate ID. 
The F5 Candidate Portal continues to be a helpful resource even after creating an account. You can log into the F5 Candidate Portal to get program updates, track your certification progress, check exam scores, update your personal information, and schedule exams at Pearson VUE testing centers.

**Additional Resources**

A commercially available study guide has been created for Exam 101. The book is titled *F5 Networks Application Delivery Fundamentals Study Guide* by Philip Jonsson and Steven Iverson. It is available for purchase in either hardcopy or electronic formats. Please know that the commercially available study guide was written and produced independent of the F5 Certified! Program. It may not align with the current version of the exam, although exam versioning is of minor concern for content included in Exam 101.
